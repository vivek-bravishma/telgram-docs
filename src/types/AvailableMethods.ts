}

// Formatting options
// The Bot API supports basic formatting for messages. You can use bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, spoiler text, block quotations as well as inline links and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages. Telegram clients will render them accordingly. You can specify text entities directly, or use markdown-style or HTML-style formatting.

// Note that Telegram clients will display an alert to the user before opening an inline link ('Open this link?' together with the full URL).

// Message entities can be nested, providing following restrictions are met:
// - If two entities have common characters, then one of them is fully contained inside another.
// - bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and spoiler entities can contain and can be part of any other entities, except pre and code.
// - blockquote and expandable_blockquote entities can't be nested.
// - All other entities can't contain each other.

// Links tg://user?id=<user_id> can be used to mention a user by their identifier without using a username. Please note:

// These links will work only if they are used inside an inline link or in an inline keyboard button. For example, they will not work, when used in a message text.
// Unless the user is a member of the chat where they were mentioned, these mentions are only guaranteed to work if the user has contacted the bot in private in the past or has sent a callback query to the bot via an inline button and doesn't have Forwarded Messages privacy enabled for the bot.
// You can find the list of programming and markup languages for which syntax highlighting is supported at libprisma#supported-languages.

// MarkdownV2 style
// To use this mode, pass MarkdownV2 in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message:

// *bold \*text*
// _italic \*text_
// __underline__
// ~strikethrough~
// ||spoiler||
// *bold _italic bold ~italic bold strikethrough ||italic bold strikethrough spoiler||~ __underline italic bold___ bold*
// [inline URL](http://www.example.com/)
// [inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)
// ![üëç](tg://emoji?id=5368324170671202286)
// `inline fixed-width code`
// ```
// pre-formatted fixed-width code block
// ```
// ```python
// pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language
// ```
// >Block quotation started
// >Block quotation continued
// >Block quotation continued
// >Block quotation continued
// >The last line of the block quotation
// **>The expandable block quotation started right after the previous block quotation
// >It is separated from the previous block quotation by an empty bold entity
// >Expandable block quotation continued
// >Hidden by default part of the expandable block quotation started
// >Expandable block quotation continued
// >The last line of the expandable block quotation with the expandability mark||
// Please note:

// Any character with code between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a preceding '\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary character and not a part of the markup. This implies that '\' character usually must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
// Inside pre and code entities, all '`' and '\' characters must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
// Inside the (...) part of the inline link and custom emoji definition, all ')' and '\' must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
// In all other places characters '_', '*', '[', ']', '(', ')', '~', '`', '>', '#', '+', '-', '=', '|', '{', '}', '.', '!' must be escaped with the preceding character '\'.
// In case of ambiguity between italic and underline entities __ is always greadily treated from left to right as beginning or end of an underline entity, so instead of ___italic underline___ use ___italic underline_**__, adding an empty bold entity as a separator.
// A valid emoji must be provided as an alternative value for the custom emoji. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker.
// Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment.
// HTML style
// To use this mode, pass HTML in the parse_mode field. The following tags are currently supported:

// <b>bold</b>, <strong>bold</strong>
// <i>italic</i>, <em>italic</em>
// <u>underline</u>, <ins>underline</ins>
// <s>strikethrough</s>, <strike>strikethrough</strike>, <del>strikethrough</del>
// <span class="tg-spoiler">spoiler</span>, <tg-spoiler>spoiler</tg-spoiler>
// <b>bold <i>italic bold <s>italic bold strikethrough <span class="tg-spoiler">italic bold strikethrough spoiler</span></s> <u>underline italic bold</u></i> bold</b>
// <a href="http://www.example.com/">inline URL</a>
// <a href="tg://user?id=123456789">inline mention of a user</a>
// <tg-emoji emoji-id="5368324170671202286">üëç</tg-emoji>
// <code>inline fixed-width code</code>
// <pre>pre-formatted fixed-width code block</pre>
// <pre><code class="language-python">pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language</code></pre>
// <blockquote>Block quotation started\nBlock quotation continued\nThe last line of the block quotation</blockquote>
// <blockquote expandable>Expandable block quotation started\nExpandable block quotation continued\nExpandable block quotation continued\nHidden by default part of the block quotation started\nExpandable block quotation continued\nThe last line of the block quotation</blockquote>
// Please note:

// Only the tags mentioned above are currently supported.
// All <, > and & symbols that are not a part of a tag or an HTML entity must be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (< with &lt;, > with &gt; and & with &amp;).
// All numerical HTML entities are supported.
// The API currently supports only the following named HTML entities: &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and &quot;.
// Use nested pre and code tags, to define programming language for pre entity.
// Programming language can't be specified for standalone code tags.
// A valid emoji must be used as the content of the tg-emoji tag. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker.
// Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment.
// Markdown style
// This is a legacy mode, retained for backward compatibility. To use this mode, pass Markdown in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message:

// *bold text*
// _italic text_
// [inline URL](http://www.example.com/)
// [inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)
// `inline fixed-width code`
// ```
// pre-formatted fixed-width code block
// ```
// ```python
// pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language
// ```
// Please note:

// Entities must not be nested, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.
// There is no way to specify ‚Äúunderline‚Äù, ‚Äústrikethrough‚Äù, ‚Äúspoiler‚Äù, ‚Äúblockquote‚Äù, ‚Äúexpandable_blockquote‚Äù and ‚Äúcustom_emoji‚Äù entities, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.
// To escape characters '_', '*', '`', '[' outside of an entity, prepend the characters '\' before them.
// Escaping inside entities is not allowed, so entity must be closed first and reopened again: use _snake_\__case_ for italic snake_case and *2*\**2=4* for bold 2*2=4.
// Paid Broadcasts
// By default, all bots are able to broadcast up to 30 messages per second to their users. Developers can increase this limit by enabling Paid Broadcasts in @Botfather - allowing their bot to broadcast up to 1000 messages per second.

// Each message broadcasted over the free amount of 30 messages per second incurs a cost of 0.1 Stars per message, paid with Telegram Stars from the bot's balance. In order to use this feature, a bot must have at least 10,000 Stars on its balance.

// Bots with increased limits are only charged for messages that are broadcasted successfully.
